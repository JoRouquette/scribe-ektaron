# Publish to VPS (Obsidian plugin + self-hosted site)

Obsidian plugin that publishes selected vault folders to your own server, plus a containerized backend + SPA that renders and serves the published site. This repository is the single source of truth for both the plugin and the self-hosted stack.

## What this gives you

- Obsidian command to package Markdown (with frontmatter filtering, routing, and asset handling) and push it securely to your VPS.
- Docker image `jorouquette/obsidian-vps-publish` that serves the API, content, and the Angular site.
- Monorepo (Nx) with backend, frontend, and shared libraries for contributors.

## Requirements

- Obsidian `>=1.5.0` on desktop (mobile not tested).
- A reachable API endpoint running this stack (see Quick start below).
- Optional for local builds: Node.js `22+` and npm.

## Install the plugin

### From release (recommended)

1. Download the latest plugin assets from GitHub Releases (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`, `versions.json`, or the packaged `vps-publish.zip`) at `https://github.com/JoRouquette/obsidian-vps-publish/releases`.
2. Create `your-vault/.obsidian/plugins/vps-publish/` (inside your vault).
3. Extract or copy the assets into that folder.
4. Reload plugins in Obsidian and enable **Publish to VPS**.

### From source

1. `npm install --no-audit --no-fund`
2. `npm run package:plugin`
3. Copy or symlink `dist/vps-publish/` into `your-vault/.obsidian/plugins/vps-publish/`.

## Quick start (Docker-backed server)

1. Run the server container (example):

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name obsidian-vps-publish `
     -p 3000:3000 `
     -e NODE_ENV=production `
     -e PORT=3000 `
     -e API_KEY=change-me `
     -e CONTENT_ROOT=/content `
     -e ASSETS_ROOT=/assets `
     -e UI_ROOT=/ui `
     -v ${PWD}/content:/content `
     -v ${PWD}/assets:/assets `
     jorouquette/obsidian-vps-publish:latest
   ```

   The container exposes `/api/**`, `/content/**`, `/assets/**`, `/health`, and `/` (SPA). See `docs/docker.md` for more options, compose files, and environment details.

2. In Obsidian, open **Settings → Community plugins → Publish to VPS**:
   - API URL: e.g., `http://localhost:3000`
   - API key: the `API_KEY` you passed to the container
   - Target folders, routes, and ignore rules to control what is published
3. Run the **Publish to VPS** command (and **Test VPS connection** if enabled).

## Features at a glance

- Property-based filtering and folder routing for published notes.
- Bundles assets alongside Markdown uploads.
- Generates and serves `_manifest.json` so the SPA can render and search your content.
- Release artifacts include a ready-to-drop `vps-publish.zip` for manual installs.
